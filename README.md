# eargASMR
## Our Team
This project was a collaboration between Dazaev Vives Cervantes, Andrew Chavez and Peter Kong. Due to hardware constraints, all code commits were done from Dazaev and Andrew's computers, but major contributions were made by all team members.

## Customize your ASMR/meditation session
[ASMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response) is growing rapidly in popularity. Currently users almost exclusively use YouTube and ASMRtists accrue millions of views for their soothing sound effects. Our app allows users to create their own ASMR sessions with sounds of their choosing.

## Features
- Select from a number of relaxing sound effects that will loop as long as you want.
- Adjust their volumes individually to create the ideal balance
- Minimal interface so you can get right into a session without stressful hoops to jump through

- Share moods with other users
- Download new sounds as DLC
- Timer so a mood plays for a desired length
